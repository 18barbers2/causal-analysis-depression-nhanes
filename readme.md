# Causal Analysis of Risk factors Associated with Depression

## Description

The goal of this project is to utilize data from the CDC's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [data](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx?BeginYear=2017) to better understand the relationship between participants' mental health and other lifestyle, demographic, and socioeconomic variables. 

In the [paper](https://github.com/18barbers2/causal-analysis-depression-nhanes/blob/main/CSINFO_Project.pdf) we investigate possible causal pathways using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and determiune the most statistically significant predictors in classifying depresssion severity.
